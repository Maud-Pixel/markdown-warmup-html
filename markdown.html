          <h2>A funny story</h2>
          <h3>A long story</h3>
          <p> When I was a french teacher, I was in a reunion with my colleguas. </br>
            But the reunion was so long ! After two ours, an old colleguas said me : </br>
            "Come, we can go out discretly". Quickly i accepted her proposition. </br>
            But it was a new big school for me and there are a lot of corridors and floors ...</br>
            even differents elevators. And there isn't lights it was the evening, in winter. </br>
            After twenty minutes we was lost in this school. Impossible to go out aniway. </br>
            So we need to call to the director ... he was in the reunion ... and we not. </br>
            So he came to get us et we can continue the reunion. Big shame and what a shame !</p>
        <h3>A short story </h3>
        <p> My ex-director saw me after I went out discretly during a reunion and he brought me back.</p>
